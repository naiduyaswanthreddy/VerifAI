# VerifAI - AI-Powered Truth Verification Platform

## Overview
VerifAI is an advanced AI-driven platform designed to combat misinformation by verifying the authenticity of news articles and videos. The platform leverages state-of-the-art AI models to analyze content credibility, ensuring users can distinguish between legitimate and misleading information. With a gamified, cyberpunk-inspired dark-themed UI, VerifAI provides an engaging and user-friendly experience for fact-checking.

## Features
âœ” **AI-Based Fact-Checking** â€“ Verify news articles for authenticity using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and trusted fact-checking sources.  
âœ” **Deepfake Video Detection** â€“ Analyze uploaded videos or URLs using AI to detect signs of digital manipulation.  
âœ” **Gamified UI Experience** â€“ Designed with a dark cyberpunk theme, glowing UI elements, and interactive features.  
âœ” **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Intuitive design ensuring seamless interaction.  
âœ” **Real-Time Verification** â€“ Get instant credibility assessments for news and videos.  
âœ” **Comprehensive Credibility Reports** â€“ Receive detailed insights about analyzed content.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Lucide-react for icons, Framer Motion for animations
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (for API development and AI model integration)
- **AI Models:** BERT (for NLP-based text analysis), MediaPipe/OpenCV (for deepfake detection)
- **Database:** Firebase or MongoDB (for storing user history and logs)
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (for frontend), AWS/GCP (for AI processing and model hosting)

## How It Works
### 1. **News Verification:**
   - Users enter a news article URL or input text manually.
   - The AI cross-checks content with fact-checking databases and linguistic analysis.
   - Displays a credibility score categorized as:
     - ðŸŸ¢ **Trustworthy** (Green)
     - ðŸŸ¡ **Unverified** (Yellow)
     - ðŸ”´ **Fake News** (Red)
   - Provides a detailed report with explanations and source references.
   
### 2. **Deepfake Video Detection:**
   - Users upload a video file or provide a URL.
   - AI analyzes frames, facial expressions, and inconsistencies using deep learning models.
   - The platform displays results indicating whether the video is authentic or AI-manipulated.
   - Generates an in-depth analysis of detected anomalies.
